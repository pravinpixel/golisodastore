Started with the cloth pads, moved to the bamboo tooth brush and now the shampoo bars, amongst the other little things that I love picking out from their store. The quality is so good, it completely shatters the notion that eco-friendly products aren't effective or durable. I also love the information that comes with all the products. It moves me along this journey of eco-friendly living that started with them!",

They've been so responsive even through the lockdown and stocked up on reusable feminine hygiene products that were not available anywhere else. They are the only brand that I know of in Chennai, that sell compost bins of multiple sizes. This product has really transformed the amount of waste that my house generates and we're so grateful for that.Goli Soda has has really helped us live mindfully even during the pandemic.If you're looking for sustainable products then Goli Soda must be on your list!",

From switching to menstrual cups to composting, Goli Soda has always been there to clarify any doubts I might have.In fact, it is because of Goli Soda that I got my entire apartment complex to start composting their food, and now we have a flourishing little garden in our compound.I also bought their shampoo bars, that come in neat eco- friendly packages, and its been such a lovely experience using them.It is so great to have a store that not only encourages an eco - friendly lifestyle, but also ensures that it is a smooth and hassle - free experience so we can continue living sustainably!",

Their upcycled bags have been my staple for gifts, their expert contemporary design of traditional products are functional and aesthetically pleasing. I also love that Goli Soda advises on sustainable living at their store and through social media. Goli Soda's offering of alternative menstrual and baby care products is a highlight for me as it's the most intimate way of making sustainable choices.",

      feedback: "Goli Soda has been a favourite store to visit ever since I decided to live a life of mindful consumption. The quality of the products, especially the soaps and eco-friendly home essentials is simply outstanding. When my children use Goli Soda All Natural probiotics dishwash bar to wash their plates and cutlery after their meal, I don't have to worry about the prolonged effect of the soap on their gentle, sensitive skin. Goli Soda is special to me for another reason, for coming to my rescue when I was faced with a delicate situation. In a bizzare accident, I burnt both my menstrual cups due to negligence while sterilizing them at a time when I had a pressing need. It was Sruti and the staff at Goli Soda store whose timely help saved my day! Happy to call myself a patron of a store that is a flag bearer of sustainable practices through mindful consumption of environment-friendly products. Double üëçüëç !",

I started moving towards sustainable living through their various products from cloth pads, bamboo toothbrush, soap, shampoo etc. Beyond their stellar products I really admire the consciousness of the brand - how they reflect it in their client servicing, display and how they work hard to stand by their values and quality of their products. It's brands like Goli Soda that give me hope that we as a society will be able to access and transition to a more eco friendly lifestyle.",
